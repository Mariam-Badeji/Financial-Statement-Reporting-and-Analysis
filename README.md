 ## Background and Overview
FinBudg is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company that provides software solutions to clients in need of digital services.

Data provided for analysis was grouped into three main sheets:
- **Transactions:** This table records the actual financial activities of the company — including the amount spent (expenses) and the amount earned (revenue). It shows each account’s real performance over time.
- **Budget:** This sheet outlines the monthly budgeted amounts for each account, both for revenue and expenses. It serves as the company’s financial plan, allowing comparison with actual performance to determine variances.
- **Accounts:** This table provides descriptive information about each account — essentially explaining what each account represents within FinBudg’s financial system. It categorizes the accounts into revenue and expense groups, helping to understand where money is coming from and where it’s going.

Together, these tables provide a comprehensive view of FinBudg’s financial health — enabling analysis of how actual results compare with budgeted expectations, and offering insights into revenue performance, expense management, and overall profitability.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Financial Overview and Performance:** Analysed the profitability of the company and comparing expenses based on accounts and classifications of the accounts
- **Revenue Analysis:** Compared the actual revenue made by the company vs the budgeted revenue based on clients and accounts
